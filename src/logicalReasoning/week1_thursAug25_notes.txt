**where to find examples from class


////////////////////////////////

Today:
- logic puzzles
- begin boolean formulas and truth tables

/////////////////////////////////

The puzzles in this lecture are all either from or inspired by:
”What is the Name of This Book?”, by Raymond Smullyan

/////////////////////////////////
The first puzzles involve the island of Knights and Knaves.
Each inhabitant is either a knight or a knave.

Knights ALWAYS tell the truth, and knaves ALWAYS lie.

/////////////////////////////////

Who can say, "I'm a knave"?

nobody!






/////////////////////////////////

You see two inhabitants, Ava and Bob.

Ava says that Bob is a knave.
Bob says, ”Neither Ava nor I are knaves.”

What are Ava and Bob?

Suppose Ava is a knight. Then Bob must be a knave. His statement is good -
    he is supposed to lie and it is TRUE that one of them is a knave.

Suppose Ava is a knave. Then Bob must be a knight. Bob's statement would
    be a lie (one of them IS a knave). Doesn't work.

Ava: knight, Bob: knave






/////////////////////////////////

You see two different inhabitants, Eve and Fred.

Eve says, ”I am a knave or Fred is a knight.”

What are Eve and Fred?

(what does the "or" mean?)

Suppose Eve is a knight. Then Fred would have to be a knight for her
    statement to be true.

Suppose Eve is a knave. Then her statement would be true, and that doesn't
    work.

Eve: knight, Fred: knight




////////////////////////////////////

You meet three inhabitants: Sarah, Bill and Mae.

Sarah tells you that only a knave would say that
    Bill is a knave.
Bill claims that it's false that Mae is a knave.
Mae tells you, “Bill would tell you that I am a knave.”

What types are Sarah, Bill, and Mae?

How could we rewrite/simplify each statement?

Sarah tells you Bill is a knight.
Bill says Mae is a knight.
Mae tells you, “Bill would tell you that I am a knave.”


Suppose Sarah is a knight. Then Bill must be a knight. Then Mae must
    also be a knight. Mae's statement would be false.

Suppose Sarah is a knave. Then Bill is a knave. Then Mae must also be
    a knave. Mae's statement works - she knows Bill would lie and
    say she was a knight, so she lies and says he would say
    she is a knave.

All knaves.

Lion always lies on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays.
Lion always tells the truth on other days.
Unicorn always lies on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays,
    and always tells the truth on other days.

On Sunday, everyone tells the truth.

Lion says:  ”Yesterday was one of my lying days.”
Unicorn says:  ”Yesterday was one of my lying days, too.”

What day is it?

not Sunday - they would both be telling the truth, and Saturday
    is not a lying day for both.

Is it Thursday? Lion's statement is true (and it should be), and
    Unicorn's statement is false (and it should be).

Monday?  Lion's statement would be good, Unicorn's would not (should
    be telling the truth).

Tues/Wed? Unicorn would be lying and should be telling the truth

Fri/Sat? Lion would be lying and should be telling the truth







////////////////////////////////

Tweedledee and Tweedledum are identical.
You know that one of them lies Mon/Tues/Wed,
and that the other lies Thurs/Fri/Sat.
(They tell the truth on non-lying days.)

You don’t know which is which.

You see both of them together.
The first one says:  ”I’m Tweedledum.”
The second one says:  ”I’m Tweedledee.”

Which is which?  What day is it?


Sunday - they would give the same name on all other days.

They are who they say.



//////////////////////////////////
Another Tweedledee and Tweedledum (same rules).

First twin: Today is Monday or Wednesday
Second twin: Today is Monday or Sunday

What day of the week is it? Wednesday

Monday: no! both statement would be true
Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday? no! both statements would be a lie
Sunday: no! one statement would be a lie
Wednesday: yes! one truth one lie






//////////////////////////////////
You know that either Tweedledum or Tweedledee has
    lost a rattle.
You find it, and want to return it to the correct one.
You don’t know what day it is, but are sure that it isn’t
    Sunday.

(so one must be lying and one must be telling the truth).

The first one says:  "Tweedledee owns the rattle.”

The second one says: ”I'm Tweedledee!”

Who gets the rattle? the first one

Suppose first one is telling the truth. Then second one is lying.
    Tweedledee owns the rattle. Second one must be Tweedledum.
    First one must be Tweedledee. The first twin gets the rattle.

Suppose second one is telling the truth. Then first one is lying,
    so Tweedledum owns rattle. We know first one is Tweedledum,
    since second one is telling the truth. The first twin gets
    the rattle.






Who is who? we don't have enough information


///////////////////////////////////////////
Based on Shakespeare's ”Merchant of Venice”.

There are three caskets – one gold, one silver,
    and one lead.
One of the caskets contains a portrait.
Each casket has a message on it, and you know that at most
    one of the messages is true.

Gold casket:  ”The portrait is in this casket.”
Silver casket:  ”The portrait is not in this casket.”
Lead casket:  ”The portrait is not in the gold casket.”

Where is the portrait? silver casket

Gold? T, T, F (too many!)
Silver? F, F, T (sure)
Lead? F, T, T (too many!)

Cheryl's birthday problem.

Written for Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad in 2015

Albert and Bernard want to know when Cheryl's birthday is.
Cheryl gives them 10 potential dates:

May 15, May 16, May 19
June 17, June 18
July 14, July 16
August 14, August 15, August 17

Cheryl privately tells Albert her birthday month.
Cheryl privately tells Bernard her birthday day (number).


Albert says: "I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is,
    but I know Bernard doesn't know too."
Albert says: "Then I also know when Cheryl's birthday is."

When is Cheryl's birthday?

Answer:


Consider Albert's statement, "I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is,
    but I know Bernard doesn't know too."

    May? no! 19 is a unique day. Albert knows Bernard might
        know the answer if it was a May birthday.
    June? also no. 18 is a unique day.
    July or August? sure. Both have no unique days.


Consider Bernard's statement: "At first I didn't know Cheryl's
    birthday, but I do now."

    Bernard knows birthday must be in July or August.
        July 14/August 14: no! If day was "14", Bernard wouldn't
            have the answer - it could be either of these days.
        August 15/17: Bernard WOULD know the answer if he was
            told either "15" or "17" - these are unique to Aug.
        July 16? Bernard would know the answer if he was told
            "16" -- the birthday would be July 16.


Consider Albert's statement: "Then I also know when Cheryl's
birthday is."


We are down to August 15, August 17, or July 16. If the answer
was August 15 or 17, Albert would NOT know when Cheryl's birthday is -
it could be either day. The only date of these where Albert would
be sure he was right is July 16.

Answer: July 16.

Start truth tables.

    p V q ^ r

Variables can be true or false
∧ is an AND (can use a caret ^ )
∨ is an OR (inclusive or) (can use a capital V)
¬ is a NOT (can use ! or ~ instead)


Basic operations:

^ - and
∨ - or
¬ - not
→ - implies


///////////////////////////////////////////////////

Fill in basic operations:


p q | p ^ q
------------
T T |   T
T F |   F
F T |   F
F F |   F

p q | p V q
------------
T T |   T
T F |   T
F T |   T
F F |   F

p | !p
-------
T | F
F | T

////////////////////////////////////////////////

IMPLIES operator ->

"If I have a test, then I will study"

p: I have a test
q: I will study

p -> q

It is false if we have BROKEN A PROMISE.
It is true otherwise.

p q | p -> q
------------
T T |   T
T F |   F
F T |   T (vacuously true)
F F |   T (vacuously true)

How does the implies operator relate to programming? if statement

//////////////////////////////////////////

Order of operations

In math? 3 - 2 + 4 - 2 * 8

P
E
M D
A S


(((3 - 2) + 4) - (2 * 8))

For logic statements:

From highest to lowest precedence:
    (), !, ^, V, ->


Given this statement:
    p -> q V !r

    (p -> (q V (!r)))


Evaluate the following truth assignment for the following variable assignments:

p is T
q is F
r is F

(p -> (F V (T)))
 T -> T
 T

////////////////////////////////////////////////

Order of operations
    ! evaluates right to left
        !!p is equivalent to....(!(!p))

    ^ and V evaluate left to right
        p ^ q ^ r is equivalent to....((p ^ q) ^ r)
        p V q V r is equivalent to....((p V q) V r)

    -> evaluates right to left
        p -> q -> r is equivalent to....(p -> (q -> r))

Truth tables in Logika

Contingent, contradictory, tautology

Contingent: a mix
Contradictory: every truth assignment makes the formula false
Tautology: every truth assignment makes the formula true
