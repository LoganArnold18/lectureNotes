HW 3 due Thursday, September 15
    (HW 4 will be posted then, due
    Thursday, September 22)

Exam 1: Thursday, September 15
    This room
    9:30-10:45 am
    No notes/no computers

** I strongly recommend finishing the homework before
    the exam -- it will help you review **

///////////////////////////////

Office hours: come to ANY times in syllabus
    (even graders and undergraduate teaching assistants)

Christopher Loura: will help with exam 1 review + HW 3 questions
    Monday-Wednesday  2:30-4:30 PM (could go overtime if needed)

//////////////////////////////

HW submission: MUST be in specified format

..../tree/(digital fingerprint)

Received a warning on HW 1/HW 2

On future homeworks, links in wrong format will get a 0

//////////////////////////////

Proving arguments in English.

Suppose we know:

I only do laundry if I go home for the weekend.
I don't do homework if I go home for the weekend.
I do homework.



We want to prove: I don't do laundry.`

///////////////////////////////

Approaching proofs

1) extract any information you can from the premises

2) look at the top-level operator of what you want to prove
    is it an ^?

    is it an ->?

    is it an V?

    is it a !?

3) if you are doing a subproof, think about what you are trying to prove RIGHT THEN
    --> follow step 2 for your subproof



We have two more rules: pbc and bottom elimination
    - Will be covered on HW 4
    - Will discuss next Tuesday, but can read ahead in textbook to get started

//////////////////////////

Exam review.

Closed notes/computers.
Please sit every other chair.

Topics:
- basic logical reasoning (multiple choice)
- logic puzzles (multiple choice)
- truth tables
- translating to propositional logic
- proofs in propositional logic (AND, OR, IMPLIES,
    !i, !e rules)

Multiple choice section + open-ended section

10 multiple choice, 6 open-ended (probably)

//////////////////////////////

Types of multiple choice problems:
- basic logical reasoning (like day 1)
- logic puzzles (knights and knaves, etc.)
- logical operator precedence
- top-level operator
- other truth table concepts (plugging in T/F values,
    seeing if something is contradictory/contingent/
    tautology, satisfiability (at least one truth
    assignment makes the formula true),
    seeing whether two statements are equivalent),
    semantic entailment
- translating an English sentence to propositional logic
- what different proof rules do, best approaches to starting a
    proof, what justification matches a proof step)

/////////////////////////////////////

Types of open-ended problems:
- completing a truth table (including marking the top-level
    operator and classifying the formula as contradictory/
    contingent/tautology)
- explaining any of the proof rules we've seen
    - in what situation can they be used?
    - what is the process of using them?
    - why does the rule "make sense" as something we can do?
- finding errors in a proof I give you
- adding either claims or justification to complete a
        partial proof
- completing full propositional logic proofs
- proofs on English arguments (translation, then proof)

//////////////////////////////////////

How to study

- memorize the truth tables for all operators (!, ^, V, ->)
- memorize the rules for order of operations
    which operators are processed first?
        (), !, ^, V, ->
    if multiple of the same operator, which is first?
        ^, V: left to right
        -> right to left
        ! right to left
    which is the top-level operator?
- memorize the format of Logika truth tables
- memorize the usage of all proof rules we've covered
    ^i, ^e1, ^e2, Vi1, Vi2, Ve, ->e, ->i, !e, !i
    look at online "proof guide"
- finish HW 3 before the exam
- complete all quiz problems
- rework homework problems without looking at the solutions
- rework all examples from lecture
    (without looking at solutions)

Review - exam 1 from Fall 2021

(this exam did NOT include !i, !e - refer to HW 3
    to study for these questions)
