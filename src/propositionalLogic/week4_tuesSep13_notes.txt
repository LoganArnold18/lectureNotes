Proving arguments in English.

Suppose we know:

I only do laundry if I go home for the weekend.
I don't do homework if I go home for the weekend.
I do homework.


We want to prove: I don't do laundry.`

Propositional atoms?

p: I do laundry
q: I go home for the weekend
r: I do homework


Translations?

I only do laundry if I go home for the weekend.

    !q -> !p

I don't do homework if I go home for the weekend.

    q -> !r

I do homework.

    r

I don't do laundry.` (conclusion)

    !p


Need to prove:

!q->!p, q->!r, r |- !p
{
    1. !q->!p               premise
    2. q->!r                premise
    3. r                    premise
    4. {
        5. p                assume
        //goal: to get !q, so we would have a _|_
        6. {
            7. q            assume
            8. !r           ->e 2 7
            9. _|_          !e 3 8
        }
        10. !q              !i 6
        11. !p              ->e 1 10
        12. _|_             !e 5 11
        //goal: contradiction
    }
    13. !p                  !i 4
}


///////////////////////////////

Approaching proofs

1) extract any information you can from the premises

2) look at the top-level operator of what you want to prove
    is it an ^?

        think of each side as a separate proof, then put together

    is it an ->?

        use a subproof, assume LHS, get to RHS by end of subproof
        use ->i afterwards to get LHS->RHS

    is it an V?

        if a premise is an OR: try using OR-elimination on it
        if you already one of the OR sides (or could get one side),
            use OR introduction

    is it a !? (trying to prove !p)

        subproof, assume p, get a contradiction, use !i to conclude !p


3) if you are doing a subproof, think about what you are trying to prove
    RIGHT THEN --> follow step 2 for your subproof



We have two more rules: pbc and bottom elimination
    - Will be covered on HW 4
    - Will discuss in detail on Tuesday, and they are in the textbook
    - We will see a brief intro now (they will NOT be on Exam 1)


//////////////////////////////

Last propositional logic proof rules.

(NOT on exam 1 -- but are needed for HW 4)

Bottom-elimination:

          _|_
_|_e:  ----------
           R




Proof by contradiction (reductio ad absurdum):

       {!P assume
        ... _|_}
pbc:  ----------
          P



//////////////////////////

Demonstrate _|_e rule:

F -> (anything)

p ^ !p |- r
{
    1. p ^ !p                   premise
    2. p                        ^e1 1
    3. !p                       ^e2 1
    4. _|_                      !e 2 3
    5. r                        _|_e 4

    //now what?
}

Not used as much - just when you need to pull
    something out of nothing




//////////////////////////

Demonstrate pbc rule (opposite of !i):

!p->!q, q |- p
{
    1. !p->!q           premise
    2. q                premise
    3. {
        4. !p           assume
        5. !q           ->e 1 4
        6. _|_          !e 2 5
    }
    7. p                pbc 3
    //now what?
}


Not used as much as !i, and harder to detect:
    If you need to prove something involving negation,
    and it doesn't fit another pattern, try pbc


//////////////////////////

Exam review.

Closed notes/computers.
Please sit every other chair.

Topics:
- basic logical reasoning (multiple choice)
- logic puzzles (multiple choice)
- truth tables
- translating to propositional logic
- proofs in propositional logic (AND, OR, IMPLIES,
    !i, !e rules)

Multiple choice section + open-ended section

10 multiple choice, 6 open-ended (probably)

//////////////////////////////

Types of multiple choice problems:

- basic logical reasoning (like day 1)

- logic puzzles (knights and knaves, etc.)

- logical operator precedence

- top-level operator

- other truth table concepts: plugging in T/F values,
    seeing if something is contradictory/contingent/
    tautology, satisfiability, equivalent statements,
    semantic entailment

Semantic entailment:

!q->!p, q->!r, r |= !p

  any time premises are all true in a truth table, then !p is also true
  in a truth table

  AND all premises together -> conclusion

  (!q->!p) ^ (q->!r) ^ r -> !p

  want this to be a tautology

- translating an English sentence to propositional logic

- what different proof rules do, best approaches to starting a
    proof, what justification matches a proof step

/////////////////////////////////////

Types of open-ended problems:

- completing a truth table (including marking the top-level
    operator and classifying the formula as contradictory/
    contingent/tautology)

- explaining any of the proof rules we've seen
    - in what situation can they be used?
    - what is the process of using them?
    - why does the rule "make sense" as something we can do?

- finding errors in a proof I give you

- adding either claims or justification to complete a
        partial proof

- completing full propositional logic proofs

- proofs on English arguments (translation, then proof)

//////////////////////////////////////

How to study

- memorize the truth tables for all operators (!, ^, V, ->)
- memorize the rules for order of operations
    which operators are processed first?
        (), !, ^, V, ->
    if multiple of the same operator, which is first?
        ^, V: left to right
        -> right to left
        ! right to left
    which is the top-level operator?
- memorize the format of Logika truth tables
- memorize the usage of all proof rules we've covered
    ^i, ^e1, ^e2, Vi1, Vi2, Ve, ->e, ->i, !e, !i
    look at online "proof guide"
- finish HW 3 before the exam
- complete all quiz problems
- rework homework problems without looking at the solutions
- rework all examples from lecture
    (without looking at solutions)

Review - exam 1 from Fall 2021

(this exam did NOT include !i, !e - refer to HW 3
    to study for these questions)
