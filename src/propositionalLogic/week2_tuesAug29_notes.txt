HW 1 due Thursday, September 1


what explanation to give

what link to submit

////////////////////////////////////////////

Today:

- more with truth tables
- equivalent statements
- translations to propositional logic

///////////////////////////////////////////

Truth table classifications?

Tautology example :
Contradictory example:

Satisfiable:

////////////////////////////////////////////

Write truth table in Logika:

p V q ^ r ^ q -> !p


Order of operations?


top-level (last applied) operator?

parse tree


//////////////////////////

Equivalent statements


If I stay up late, then I will be tired.



--> what are equivalent statements (true in the same cases, and false in the same cases?)

Another implies?

As an OR?




p: I stay up late
q: I will be tired



How could we translate each statement?




How could we show they were equivalent
    with truth tables?

-------------
p q | p -> q
-------------
T T |   T
T F |   F
F T |   T
F F |   T
-------------

-------------
p q | !p V q
-------------
T T | F  T
T F | F  F
F T | T  T
F F | T  T
-------------

--------------
p q | !q -> !p
--------------
T T | F  T  F
T F | T  F  F
F T | F  T  T
F F | T  T  T
--------------

/////////////////////////

if (!p && !q)


--> how else could we write this if-statement?

--> how could we write these as logical formulas?


if (!p || !q)

--> how else could we write this if-statement?

--> how could we write these as logical formulas?

//////////////////////////

Propositional logic
- a set of propositions (statements that can be T/F)
- connected by logical operators

To translate:
1) Identify all propositional atoms in the sentence,
    assign letters to them
2) Make sure propositional atoms don't include logical
    operators (like "not")
3) Translate to propositional statements with appropriate
    operators




//////////////////////////

Negation (NOT): look for "un", "ir", "not" in sentence

**Example: I am not going to work today.

Atom:


Translation:








//////////////////////////

Conjunction (AND): look for "and", "but", "however",
    "moreover", "nevertheless", etc.

I like cake, but I also like ice cream.

**Example: I am hungry and thirsty.

Atoms:



Translation:




**Example: I am short but John is not tall.

Atoms:


Translation:





//////////////////////////

Disjunction (OR): look for "or", interpret whether the or
is inclusive or exclusive. Ours will be inclusive unless we use
"either...but not both" language



**Example: You can watch a movie and/or eat a snack.

Atoms:
p: You can watch a movie
q: You can eat a snack

Translation:






**Example: You can have chips or fries, but not both.

Atoms:
p: You can have chips
q: You can have fries

Translation:









**Example: Fred neither washed the car nor
    went to the mechanic.

Atoms:


Translation:





**In this class, it's safe to assume "or" is inclusive
    unless otherwise clearly specified.

///////////////////////////////////////////

Implication (IMPLIES): "if...then", "provided...then",
    "only...", "given...", "assuming...", "unless..."

**Pay attention to what is being promised, like:
    (given this condition) -> (we can infer this conclusion)




**Example: If it is hot today, then I'll get ice cream.

Atoms:
p: It's hot today
q: I'll get ice cream

Translation:






**Example: You can login to a CS lab computer if you have
    a CS account.

Atoms:
p: You have a CS account
q: You can login to a CS lab computer

What conditions need to be met for me to SURE I can login?


Translation:









**Example: Wilma eats cookies only if Evelyn makes them.

Atoms:
p: Wilma eats cookies
q: Evelyn makes cookies

What conditions need to be met for Wilma to eat cookies?
...if Wilma is eating cookies?
...if Evelyn didn't make them?

Translations (write TWO):






**Example: I will walk to campus unless it is raining.
(Think of UNLESS as "EXCEPT POSSIBLY IF")

Atoms:
p: I will walk to campus
q: It is raining

What conditions need to be met for me to walk?

Translation:












**Example: If it snows today, I will go sledding;
    otherwise, I'll stay inside.

Atoms:
p: It snows today
q: I will go sledding
r: I'll stay inside

What is being promised? More than one thing?




Translation:










**Example: I will not like radishes unless my tastes change
    or I learn to cook them in another way.

Atoms:

What am I promising?

Translations:







//////////////////////////////////
Summary:

p: I swim
q: It is hot


IF p THEN q:
If I swim, then it is hot




p ONLY IF q:
I will swim ONLY if it is hot



p IF q:
I will swim if it is hot.



p UNLESS q:
I will swim unless it is hot.




//////////////////////////////////

Contrapositive.




//////////////////////////////////

Implication as a disjunction.






...BUT! We should still build our translations to match
the English sentence as well as we can.


////////////////////////////////////

Knights and knaves with truth tables

Eve says, ”I am a knave or Fred is a knight.”

(they must both be knights)

e: Eve is a knight
!e: Eve is not a knight (Eve is a knave)
f: Fred is a knight
!f: Fred is not a knight (Fred is a knave)


Translation?

Solve with a truth table?

/////////////////////////

Ava says that Bob is a knave.
Bob says, ”Neither Ava nor I are knaves.”

a: Ava is a knight
!a: Ava is a knave
b: Bob is a knight
!b: Bob is a knave

Translation?
