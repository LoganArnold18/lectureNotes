////////////////////////////////////////////

Today:

- more with truth tables
- equivalent statements
- translations to propositional logic

///////////////////////////////////////////

Truth table classifications?

Tautology example : all truth assignments make the overall statement true

    p V !p

Contradictory example: all truth assignments make the overall statement false

    p ^ !p

Contingent: a mix - some truth assignments make the overall statement true,
    some make it false

Satisfiable - at least one truth assignment makes a statement true
    (tautology and contingent are satisfiable)

////////////////////////////////////////////

Write truth table in Logika:

p V q ^ r ^ q -> !p


Order of operations?


top-level (last applied) operator?

parse tree


//////////////////////////

Equivalent statements - what does this mean?


If I stay up late, then I will be tired.




--> what are equivalent statements for the above?

Another implies? If I'm not tired, I must not have stayed up late.

As an OR? I didn't stay up late or I am tired.




p: I stay up late
q: I will be tired



How could we translate each statement?


If I stay up late, then I will be tired.

p -> q

If I'm not tired, I must not have stayed up late.

!q -> !p

I didn't stay up late or I am tired.

!p V q


How could we show they were equivalent?

truth tables should be the same





-------------
p q | p -> q
-------------
T T |   T
T F |   F
F T |   T
F F |   T
-------------

-------------
p q | !p V q
-------------
T T | F  T
T F | F  F
F T | T  T
F F | T  T
-------------

--------------
p q | !q -> !p
--------------
T T | F  T  F
T F | T  F  F
F T | F  T  T
F F | T  T  T
--------------

/////////////////////////

if (!p && !q)


--> how else could we write this if-statement?

if (!(p V q))



--> how could we write these as logical formulas?









if (!p || !q)

--> how else could we write this if-statement?

if (!(p ^ q))



--> how could we write these as logical formulas?





//////////////////////////

Propositional logic
- a set of propositions (statements that can be T/F)
- connected by logical operators

To translate:
1) Identify all propositional atoms in the sentence,
    assign letters to them
2) Make sure propositional atoms don't include logical
    operators (like "not")
3) Translate to propositional statements with appropriate
    operators




//////////////////////////

Negation (NOT): look for "un", "ir", "not" in sentence

**Example: I am not going to work today.

Atom:

p: I am going to work today

Translation: !p








//////////////////////////

Conjunction (AND): look for "and", "but", "however",
    "moreover", "nevertheless", etc.

I like cake, but I also like ice cream.

**Example: I am hungry and thirsty.

Atoms:

p: I am hungry
q: I am thirsty



Translation: p ^ q




**Example: I am short but John is not tall.

Atoms:

p: I am short
q: John is tall

Translation: p ^ !q





//////////////////////////

Disjunction (OR): look for "or", interpret whether the or
is inclusive or exclusive. Ours will be inclusive unless we use
"either...but not both" language



**Example: You can watch a movie and/or eat a snack.

Atoms:
p: You can watch a movie
q: You can eat a snack

Translation: p V q






**Example: You can have chips or fries, but not both.

Atoms:
p: You can have chips
q: You can have fries

Translation: !(p ^ q) ^ (p V q)









**Example: Fred neither washed the car nor
    went to the mechanic.

Atoms:
p: Fred washed the car
q: Fred went to the mechanic

Translation: !p ^ !q
!(p V q)





**In this class, it's safe to assume "or" is inclusive
    unless otherwise clearly specified.

///////////////////////////////////////////

Implication (IMPLIES): "if...then", "provided...then",
    "only...", "given...", "assuming...", "unless..."

**Pay attention to what is being promised, like:
    (given this condition) -> (we can infer this conclusion)



//////////////////////////////////
Summary:

p: I swim
q: It is hot


IF p THEN q:
If I swim, then it is hot

p -> q (false when p is true and q is false)


p ONLY IF q:
I will swim ONLY if it is hot

I promise if it's not hot I won't swim
!q -> !p


p IF q:
I will swim if it is hot.
If it is hot, then I will swim

q -> p (false when q is true and p is false)


p UNLESS q (unless possibly if, except [possibly if])
I will swim unless [possibly if] it is hot.

If it's not hot, I will always swim

!q -> p

!p -> q


//////////////////////////////////

Contrapositive.

p -> q

!q -> !p



//////////////////////////////////

Implication as a disjunction.


p -> q

!p V q



...BUT! We should still build our translations to match
the English sentence as well as we can.




///////////////////////////////////////////

**Example: If it is hot today, then I'll get ice cream.

Atoms:
p: It's hot today
q: I'll get ice cream

Translation: p -> q






**Example: You can login to a CS lab computer if you have
    a CS account.

Atoms:
p: You have a CS account
q: You can login to a CS lab computer

What conditions need to be met for me to SURE I can login?

p -> q

Translation:









**Example: Wilma eats cookies only if Evelyn makes them.

Atoms:
p: Wilma eats cookies
q: Evelyn makes cookies

What conditions need to be met for Wilma to eat cookies?
...if Wilma is eating cookies? p -> q
...if Evelyn didn't make them? !q -> !p

Translations (write TWO):






**Example: I will walk to campus unless it is raining.
(Think of UNLESS as "EXCEPT POSSIBLY IF")

Atoms:
p: I will walk to campus
q: It is raining

What conditions need to be met for me to walk?

if it's not raining, then I'll walk

Translation: !q -> p












**Example: If it snows today, I will go sledding;
    otherwise, I'll stay inside.

Atoms:
p: It snows today
q: I will go sledding
r: I'll stay inside

What is being promised? More than one thing?

if it snows, I'll sled. If it doesn't snow, I'll stay inside.


Translation: (p -> q) ^ (!p -> r)









**Example: I will not like radishes unless [possibly if] my tastes change
    or I learn to cook them in another way.

Atoms:

p: I like radishes
q: My tastes change
r: I learn to cook them differently

What am I promising?

Translations:

If I do like radishes, then [one of those things happened]
p -> (q V r)

If neither happened, then I still hate radishes

!(q V r) -> !p








////////////////////////////////////

Knights and knaves with truth tables

Eve says, ”I am a knave or Fred is a knight.”

(they must both be knights)

e: Eve is a knight
!e: Eve is not a knight (Eve is a knave)
f: Fred is a knight
!f: Fred is not a knight (Fred is a knave)

(e -> (!e V f)) ^ (!e -> !(!e V f))

(e -> (!e V f)) ^ (!e -> (e ^ f))


Translation?

Solve with a truth table?

/////////////////////////

Ava says that Bob is a knave.
Bob says, ”Neither Ava nor I are knaves.”

a: Ava is a knight
!a: Ava is a knave
b: Bob is a knight
!b: Bob is a knave

Translation?

(try doing this one on your own)
